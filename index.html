        <a href="/" class="text-link">Chris Clark</a> is an interactive designer and front-end developer.
        Some people call him Chrissy, which you can also do, unless of course you
        donâ€™t wanna, which is just totally fine.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        For five years he worked at <a class="text-link" href="http://genius.com">Genius</a>
        designing and writing code, while helping the founders grow a hobby website into one of
        the biggest music platforms on the planet.  On the side he designs, develops,
        photographs, and writes for a very fancy <a href="http://tuxedono2.com" class="text-link">cocktail site</a>
        with his partner, Meredith.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        He received an MFA in graphic design from the Maryland Institute
        College of Art, and his thesis, Web Typography for the Lonely, has been
        exhibited in galleries around the country. His writing is published in
        several collaborative books on typography and design, and he has work
        featured in NPR and the New York Times. His illustrations even made the cover
        of NYT Magazine once.
      </p>
      <p class="text-block">
        He is an avid backpacker and climber, with a bit of a soft
        spot for smartly designed gear. He loves cooking, dressing well, and as you
        might have guessed, music. If you are still reading this, you might be
        considering contacting him about a fun and exciting project to work on, which
        you can do by sending an email to the long word below.
